# Python Checkpoint 1

## Before You Start

**Before you begin anything:**

* Create a new virtual environment (`python3 -m virtualenv <path-to-virtualenv>`)
* Activate the virtual environment (`source <path-to-virtualenv>/bin/activate`)
* Install the dependencies in `requrements.txt` (`pip install -r
    requirements.txt`)
* run `pytest` to check that the test are working (`pytest`)

To run the tests in the terminal, run `pytest`. Every time you make a change and
save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all
of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in
the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.

## Instructions

This checkpoint is divided into three sections:

* Data Types in `data_types.py`
* Methods in `methods.py`
* Object Oriented Programming in `oop.py`

Each section has a series of prompts written in inline comments. Write the
Python necessary to complete each prompt in each of the three files.

**Make a commit after you complete each section.**

**DO NOT** Modify the files in the `tests/` folder.

## Submission
Fork this repository and clone your fork locally. Commit as you go. When you are
finished, push your commits to GitHub.

**Wait until the end of the hour to make your Pull Request.**
